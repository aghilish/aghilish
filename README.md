### Hello world... 👋

- My name is Shahrooz Aghili. I'm a Platform Engineer based in Frankfurt, Germany.
- 🚀 Enthusiastic about the DevOps culture and focused on Open Source technologies, I am passionate about automation, with 12+ years of experience as a Software Engineer, Researcher and Technical lead.
- Currently working as a Platform Engineer and Senior Consultant, always open to learning new technologies and procedures to improve every day more as a professional.
- 👀 I’m interested in Open Source projects (CNCF) and fascinated about _Cloud Native_ 🚀 and _Generative AI_ 🤖 and looking for usecases to marry the two. 
- 📫 How to reach me: on any social media platform you like 😄
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you're struggling to pronounce my first name, just go with _Roozy_. That's what my friends and colleagues use.
